- 👋 Hi, I’m Ruslan Barotov
- 👨‍💻 I am interested in website development and am actively learning programming languages ​​such as JavaScript, Python and Java. 
     In recent months, I have also deepened my knowledge of the Angular framework, 
     which allows you to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
